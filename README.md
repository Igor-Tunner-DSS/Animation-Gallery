This is a personal project that both transcribes and showcases some animations available on: https://ascii.co.uk/animated
You can add your own animations, but the program will only accept animations from that site, added in a very specific way. Inside 'animations.txt', the animation 
are contained in a dictionary composed of 'title : frames' where 'frames' is the text found on the desired animation's html source code, on line 53. It can quickly be identified by its absurd length.
